In my assignment, I created the code for the cycle of the day, starting from sunrise and ending at nighttime. I use various conditional statements to allow for user interaction and engagement. I use an animation of a bird that changes along with the user interaction to allow for the user to enjoy the scenery. I chose to create this for my project because I enjoy watching the sky during the day and I love the peace that comes with it, and I hope you do too!
